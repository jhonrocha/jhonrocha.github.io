Hi, I am Jhon Rocha. I am a Software Engineer with eight years of experience building efficient and exciting applications, mainly on Back-End, using Javascript, Node.js, AWS, Azure, Postgres, and MySQL. 
I've also been working on personal projects with Python, Go, and Rust, fascinating languages that interest me a lot.
