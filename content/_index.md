# Hi there! ðŸ––
I am Jhon, a software and automation engineer and I am professionally focused on developing Back-End solutions using Node and AWS applications.

You can find me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jhonrocha), [email](jhmrocha@gmail.com) and [github](https://github.com/jhonrocha), where I spend most of time learning by practicing Rust, Python and AWS or ricing my Arch Linux and Vim configs.

Bellow you can find my resume in english and in portuguÃªs (I am from Brasil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·).
