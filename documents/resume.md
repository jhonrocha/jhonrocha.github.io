# About me

---

Hi, I am Jhon Rocha. I am a Software Engineer with eight years of experience building efficient and exciting applications, mainly on Back-End, using Javascript, Node.js, AWS, Azure, Postgres, and MySQL. 
I've also been working on personal projects with Python, Go, and Rust, fascinating languages that interest me a lot.

## Experience

### Software Engineer

- [*Nearform*](http://nearform.com/)
- *Jan 2022 – Present*

As a Senior Software Engineer, I build, deploy, and maintain scalable projects for diverse clients. The main project I worked on was about implementing pipelines on Azure DataFactory and FunctionApps to integrate a Postgres Datalake, two MSSQL databases, and Salesforce.
Besides those, some of the technologies used were: Node.js, Typescript, Javascript, Python, and Azure.

### Team Lead

- [*BairesDev*](http://bairesdev.com/)
- *Aug 2020 – Dec 2021*

As a leader, I am responsible for helping the team's performance by managing tasks, planning and assignments, and ensuring code cohesion and efficiency.

### Software Engineer

- [*BairesDev*](http://bairesdev.com/)
- *Dec 2018 – Sep 2020*

As a core member of the services team, I have been working on developing solutions for the client. My primary focus is to support and evolve a Node environment entirely powered by AWS. Part of the structure runs as a monolith and part as microservices, using Lambdas, SNS, and SQS. It is also part of the work to develop
some React tools for internal usage.

- Back-End: Node (Sails.js, Express)
- Operation: Amazon AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, SNS, SQS, Elasticache, RDS)
- Front-End: React

- [*Metrópoles Mídia e Comunicação*](https://www.metropoles.com/)
- *Feb 2018 - Nov 2018*

Development and maintenance of a Newspaper Content System. Major concerns were
high availability, consistent quality, and speed to the end consumer.

- Front-End: Bootstrap, Ionic 2, Angular 4, Vue.js, Pug, Stylus
- Back-End: WordPress, PHP, and MySQL
- Operation: Amazon AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS)

### Full Stack Developer

### Member (Academic Team) at Robot Soccer Team

- [*UnBeatables: UnB humanoid robot soccer team*](https://www.facebook.com/unbeatablesbr/)
- *Sep 2014 – Aug 2016*

I was responsible for the network area, handling communication between robot-to-robot
and robot-to-computer. I also worked in movement and locomotion,
expanding the robot player's set of gestures and actions. Finally, I
developed the structure of the behavior state machine, implementing the reaction
to events autonomously and elaborating new roles for the player.

Technologies used:

- NAO Robot
- C++
- Python
- Communication Networks (UDP/TCP)
- Linux
